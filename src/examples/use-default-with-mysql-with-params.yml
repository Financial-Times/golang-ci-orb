  Example using orb's job build-and-test with default-with-mysql executor
  passing custom paramaters defined in the executor config in order to build,
  lint and test Go project with MySQL. Note that we can only pass parameters
  defined and used in the executor's config file.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    ft-golang-ci: financial-times/golang-ci@1
  workflows:
    tests_and_docker:
      jobs:
        - ft-golang-ci/build-and-test:
            name: build-and-test-project
            executor-name:
              name: ft-golang-ci/default-with-mysql
              mysql-root-password: "pass"
              mysql-database: "test"

        - ft-golang-ci/docker-build:
            name: build-docker-image
            requires:
